Here's a fun little synthesis of thoughts:
* I enjoy reading and I read about ~10 books per year
* After 5-10[^1] years[^2], if I reread an old book, it's almost like I'm reading it for the first time

Thus: **If I can find 50-100 books that I absolutely adore, I could just rotate reading through those books and be set for life!**[^3] And wouldn't it be fun if I had my list and my friends had theirs, and we could compare notes?
 
And so, here's my 100 Books:

[^1]: I'm still trying to figure out my exact _N_ here, but I'm guessing it will fall somewhere between 6-10 years. From experience, for N=5 years after I've read a book, I'll have forgotten most of the content but maybe rememeber wisps of how the book made me feel. N=10 is a nice round number and seems promising, but I only started tracking what books I've read since 2016 so I don't have any candidates to test this out on yet.

[^2]: Interestingly this near-decade-long decay seems to only apply to books I actually like. I was looking back at what books I've read over the years, and there were books I'd read just 3 years ago that I didn't really care for that I had already completely 100% forgotten about.

[^3]: Of course I doubt I would just exclusively stick to this rotation of books and never read anything new again. But I love the _idea_ of having such a list.
