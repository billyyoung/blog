_This one goes out to all of us who are constantly distracted by shiny new ideas._  

One guiding rule I had in my 20s was to focus on doing things that I wanted to do, things that brought me joy; and to be conscious of doing things I didn't want to do (but maybe had to). 

But I realize now that there's [A LOT](https://twitter.com/billyisyoung/status/1338707210914893827) of things I want to do, to varying degrees of desire, probably too many to get to meaningfully in one lifetime. So maybe this one rule needs some refining and some better prioritization. 

Enter the 5/25 Rule, which I learned about from reading [Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54785515-four-thousand-weeks) (a very Billy book; would recommend if you like my writing). This tip (falsely attributed to Warren Buffett)  pierced through me. It's compelling, it's sharp, and it's changed how I think about Doing Things, and choosing what Things to do.

It goes something like this:  

* Write down a list of all the things you want to do: your goals, your ambitions, your dreams, your whims, your never-gonna-happen-but-if-I-coulds
* Prioritize that list down to your Top 25
* Prioritize that list again down your Top 5
* Circle your Top 5, and focus on those things

The kicker? **Actively avoid** #6-25 to maintain focus on #1-5 (since those are the things that are most likely to distract you from #1-5 as they're your next top interests).

Now I'm not suggesting you follow this advice to a T (_post to come about "rogue agent mindset" and always filtering for what actually works best for you_). But mull it over and see if it pokes you in the proverbial ribs in any areas of your worldview.

Its corollary has also been a ball of negative emotions I've been digesting: that you will need to choose and sacrifice and give up and mourn the things you choose to no longer do. But know that it's in service of helping you more on what you **really** want to do. 

(Some tellings of the 5/25 Rule say "Everything you didnâ€™t circle just became your Avoid-At-All-Cost list," but I prefer to be a bit less black-and-white about advice. Your priorities change! You change! So hold onto all of this loosely.)

For reference, here are my "Top 5" right now:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">goals v1.1<br>- write 100 blog posts<br>- practice music semi-regularly (singing, piano, drums)<br>- keep drawing<br>- keep investing in relationships<br>- lose weight via better diet<br>- take a sabbatical this year (and eventually test out some other income streams) <a href="https://t.co/mrTUpQpGyz">https://t.co/mrTUpQpGyz</a></p>&mdash; billy is writing again (14/100) (@billyisyoung) <a href="https://twitter.com/billyisyoung/status/1610796791150125058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Other interests I've made peace with and retired (for now), due to some combination of realizing that they're not in my Top 5 (I want the Top 5 _more_), or no longer having the supportive context, or the activation energy getting too high. These include:  

* A cappella
* Tennis
* [Climbing Ranked in Valorant](https://twitter.com/billyisyoung/status/1399417692726063110)
* Hunting out good restaurants

If you're looking for help with your own prioritization, here are some tips:  

* Actually do the 5/25 prioritization exercise! Or any kind of prioritization exercise really
* If you're looking for more specifics on goal-crafting, [here](https://interintellect.com/salon/goal-crafting-foundations-dreaming-big/) are some resources from the one [I did in 2022](https://twitter.com/billyisyoung/status/1477748284521390082)
* Take some time and think about any broad-strokes goals you have or themes you've noticed in your life, and use them as a loose North Star (e.g. 'I like solving problems', or 'I like mentoring and teaching people'). Tweak them as you go through life
