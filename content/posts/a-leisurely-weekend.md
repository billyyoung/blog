I spent the past weekend in absolute satisfaction. In Flow. Time rushed by, yet I was immersed in each moment. I cooked multiple meals with my roommate (Indian bread rolls and Bombay sandwiches), started and finished season 1 of Ted Lasso, played tennis, and watched the Come From Away musical. I even had time to run some errands, draw, zoom call a twitter friend, and redecorate my apartment a little.

What felt like a pleasing weekend now also feels bloated. Kinda like when you eat too many sweets in one sitting. It feels a bit empty now too, like in the same vein wanting some solid food after all those sweets but not being able to stomach it yet.

I love being in the moment. Enjoying an experience or a show. _Feeling_; especially that tight-in-the-chest, choked up feeling a show like Ted Lasso makes you feel. But as the moment ends, as I fall out of Flow, a part of me looks back and tries to make sense of the time that's passed, to assign some narrative to it. And present-me views that recently-gone me with a mix of emotions. There's satisfaction, but it's only in part. There's a bittersweet feeling too, like yearning and regret and hope all rolled into one. 

I have a book that's been sitting on my shelf for months now that I want to read but the title is self-explanatory enough that the topic has been able to stick itself in my brain anyway and not let go. It's called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74034">Amusing Ourselves to Death</a>, and it comes to mind here.

Did I spend this weekend resting? Did I spend it wasting away on the couch? Like with all things, the real answer is probably somewhere in the middle. I don't want to beat myself up about it. There is a time for rest and relaxation, and it's important to get adequate rest! But also: did I get anything, anything lasting out of watching 7 hours of TV? When I also want to read a book, or write, or <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/competitive-games-are-fun/">practice some games</a>.

This weekend is all of that -- it's living proof of the gap between my revealed preferences and my stated preferences. Makes me wonder why. I could attribute it to myself, my environment, work, my roommate, how easy it is to pull up Netflix, how good TV has become. How quickly I can get distracted by something playing in the background and become absorbed in a show I knew nothing about a few minutes prior (this is literally how I got into season 8 of The Blacklist). 

And as I'm writing the paragraph above, two words come to mind: blame, and forgiveness. What an interesting frame to default to. Forgiveness implies some wrongdoing; forgiveness for what? For "falling into temptation"? Or meta: for beating myself up about something that I shouldn't be beating myself up about? (Or more meta: for viewing this as something I _should_ or _shouldn't_ be doing?)

And yet! And yet, after aaaall of that pacing and pondering: I write most of this piece at the end of the same weekend, at 12AM on Sunday night. And I feel good about it, about having done some writing after all, and about what I've written. Maybe that's just how it goes sometimes.
