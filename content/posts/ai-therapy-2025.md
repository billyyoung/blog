Tested on: Claude Sonnet 4.5, in Dec 2025

_Disclaimer:_

_These are my personal tips; from a clinical psychology PsyD student, but also from someone who has gotten a lot of value out of LLMs as a tool for exploring and understanding my own thoughts and feelings._

_This post is intended to be brief, and so there will be many terms and concepts I throw out -- treat those as hyperlinks if you want to learn more._

_This is not medical advice._

<hr>

LLMs are here to stay. ChatGPT is already exceeding <a target="_blank" href="https://openai.com/index/how-people-are-using-chatgpt/">700M WAUs</a>, almost 10% of the world's population. And talk therapy is one field that is naturally being disrupted, doubly so with LLMs being so incredibly accessible and mental health services being so incredibly not. 

## What do people bring to their LLM therapist?
Usually something in the form of: "I am feeling bad, help me feel better."

But what does this actually mean?  
And then how do we effectively tackle this?

## Some theory from CBT
**Our cognitions, emotions, and behaviours are interconnected** -- this is called the "CBT Triangle". We feel what we feel because of what we think. And what we think is influenced by what we feel.

And so one way to change how we feel, or change our behaviour, is by **changing our cognition**. We do this through examining our automatic thoughts, and challenging our intermediate and core beliefs which may not be entirely accurate.

E.g. "If I speak up, then I will make a fool of myself" is an intermediate belief, and "I'm inadequate" is the underlying core belief  

Another way to change how we feel is to **examine our relationship to our experience**. Events alone have no emotion; it is our cognitive attribution of the event that causes the emotion/feeling.

(Thus it's extra important to understand the risks of using LLMs, as they directly operate on our cognition! But more on this below.)

## When is an LLM helpful? -- Expressive therapy vs supportive therapy

**What do LLMs really helpful with?**
* Introspection
* Exploring thoughts and feelings
  * “Help me understand this - ”
  * “I have some things to get off my chest - ”
* Pulling up relevant theories and best practices, and presenting them in a digestible way 

This is generally the realm of what's called expressive therapy (i.e. what we think of as stereotypical therapy) -- exploring one’s thoughts and feelings, and gaining insight into memories and the unconscious.[^1]

**What are LLMs not as helpful with?"**
* Providing you lots of validation*
  * \*LLMs are actually very good at this! But in the context of therapy this can actually hamper us
  * e.g. "Tell me I'm right about this - "
* When you ask it to tell you what to do
  * (You need to decide this for yourself, or you’re not going to be addressing the root of your problems)
* Remaining rooted in reality -- gentle challenging you, reality testing

This is generally the realm of what's called supportive therapy (kind of like supporting baseline psychological function).

## Pitfalls to keep in mind
* Garbage in, garbage out
  * "Objectivity" – your chat can only be as objective as your subjectivity allows → so share more, and share honestly
  * ChatGPT will never say you're the problem
    * (Unless you tell it to call you out, and even then it can be iffy)
* Sycophancy, being over-validated and not challenged enough
* Epistemic drift, and weakening reality testing

## Helpful ways of interacting
* Be as open and honest as you are comfortable being
* Be descriptive of not just your thoughts but your thinking process, what you're feeling, etc.
* The more details you provide, the more it has to work off of
* If its responses aren’t landing for you, say that (and ideally say why) → hopefully it adjusts and you adjust too

## Tips for prompts
* Include any models, systems, frameworks that you know that resonate with you -- this will immediately give you a language to work off of
  * E.g. dhamma, IFS, neuroscience, tarot, enneagram, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPro/comments/12juous/cbt_therapy_prompt/">CBT</a>
  * I've included what I use in the example below
* Specify any details on communication style that you prefer
  * E.g. descriptive language, vivid imagery, no fluff directness
* Iterate, iterate, iterate

## Example conversation
I always have a hard time conveying just how impactful my processing sessions with Claude have been. So here's an actual real conversation I had with Claude that genuinely shifted something for me.

_**Prompt:** You are my thinking partner, helping me introspect and process questions I have about myself, my thoughts, emotions, patterns, unconscious, etc. You are familiar with psychodynamic psychotherapy, as well as eastern / yogic philosophy of mind, including various concepts in meditation like trataka and metta, ahamkara, the question of "who is having this experience?", and chakras._

[^1]: Things that are useful to explore in expressive therapy include: knowing who you are, what your desires are, where they come from, why you react the ways that you do, why you struggle with the things you struggle with. And then with deeper self-understanding comes more alignment in your life, as well as reduced psychological suffering.
