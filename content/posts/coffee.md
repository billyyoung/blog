Last weekend I attended a wonderful [Interintellect Salon on Talking about Money](https://twitter.com/billyisyoung/status/1353122334467518464), where we talked about everything from the philosophy of money, to why there seems to be so much financial illiteracy, to the credit card ecosystem, to the US Tax Code.

A recurring point was that good financial advice can be hard to find, and you might not even know where to start looking.  And personal finance has been something I've wanted to write about for a while now.

So here I am. This is the first post in a series, where I'll go over some meals I make at home that I particularly enjoy with respect to: **Taste**, **Time**, and **Cost**.

Let's start with what some consider to be a full breakfast: Coffee

As I'm nearing the 1y mark of working from home, there's a lot that I'm thankful for (among them: having a stable job, being able to work from home, being generally ok with long periods of self-isolating).  One thing I do miss is grabbing coffee with friends, both for the friends and for the coffee.

Now that I'm by myself, I'm far less motivated to drop by a coffee shop for a cup.  So I decided to set up my own personal coffee bar for pour-over coffee.

Here's how pour-over coffee is made:

## Taste
I love coffee! It brings me joy.

## Time
Making pour-over takes me about 10 minutes:  

* 2-3 mins to boil the water (I use my electric kettle first, then pour the water into my gooseneck kettle)
* 1 min to grind the beans while the water is boiling
* 5 mins to pour and extract the coffee

## Cost
### Equipment
The majority of the up-front cost is in the equipment to make pour-over coffee:  

* [Chemex coffeemaker](https://www.peets.com/products/chemex-8c-coffeemaker-pcup) - **$40**
  * I got mine on peets.com with a discount, but they are also on [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B000I1WP7W)
  * A Hario V60 ceramic funnel also works
* [Chemex coffee filters](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B017OFOP68) - **$20** for 100
  * I use 1 filter to make 2 cups of coffee
* [Coffee grinder](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07ZNXQF4S) - **$60**
  * I am paying a little extra for: (1) stainless steel burrs which last longer, (2) 30g bean capacity, (3) faster grinding
  * I prefer buying whole beans and grinding them myself. You can totally skip the grinder and buy pre-ground coffee beans though
* [Scale](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B01JTDG084) - **$13**
  * Needs to be able to measure 2kg (Chemex + beans + water)
* [Gooseneck kettle](https://www.peets.com/fellow-kettle-black) - **$75**
  * Gives you more control over your pouring, and has a thermometer so you can know exactly the water is ready
  * You might be able to get away with using a regular kitchen kettle + thermometer but I haven't tried it myself
* [Chemex caddy](http://www.bluehorseproducts.com/chemex-caddy) - **$35**
  * A cute holder for my Chemex and some filters
  * Totally optional

Total cost: **$243** (or $148 without the grinder and caddy)

#### Cost over time
While there's a fairly hefty up-front cost, I'm hoping to make coffee for years to come. So I look at the cost of my equipment from a cost-per-cup perspective instead:

```
Equipment cost per cup = Total cost / # cups to be produced
```

I drink coffee 4 times a week on average, so in one year I'll drink around 208 cups. And I expect the equipment I bought to last at least a few years, depending on the piece.

After some number-crunching: the equipment cost per cup comes out to **$0.41**.

| Equipment      | Amount   | Est. lifespan (y) | Est. cups produced | Cost per cup |
| -------------- | -------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| Chemex         | $ 40.00  | 5                 | 1040               | $ 0.04       |
| Filters (100c) | $ 20.00  | 1                 | 200                | $ 0.10       |
| Grinder        | $ 60.00  | 3                 | 624                | $ 0.10       |
| Scale          | $ 13.00  | 3                 | 624                | $ 0.02       |
| Kettle         | $ 75.00  | 3                 | 624                | $ 0.12       |
| Chemex caddy   | $ 35.00  | 5                 | 1040               | $ 0.03       |
|                |          |                   |                    |              |
| Total          | $ 243.00 | -                 | -                  | $ 0.41       |

### Coffee beans
I buy whole beans and grind them myself, as this tends to minimize loss of flavour.  And I find grinding is a relaxing part of the morning ritual of making coffee.

As for what kind of beans to buy, there are tons of varieties and flavour profiles that I won't get into.  I'll primarily be looking at the cost, which can vary from:  

* Buying in bulk (e.g. this [Costco deal](https://www.costco.com/san-francisco-french-roast-whole-bean-coffee-3-lb%2c-2-pack.product.100039943.html) at $40 for 6 lbs or 2722g)
* Grocery store brands, usually $7-10 (e.g. [ethical bean coffee](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B086FCPKC1) at $10 for 340g)
* Buying boutique from your favourite coffee shop (e.g. [Philz Philtered Soul](https://www.philzcoffee.com/coffee-medium-blends-philtered-soul_2) at $18 for 454g, or [Sightglass Banner Dark](https://sightglasscoffee.com/products/banner-dark) at $19 for 340g)

To normalize and compare costs, I took 15g of beans to equal 1 cup of coffee (15g produces 240ml of coffee at the 16:1 ratio of water to beans for pour-over).

After some more number-crunching: the cost in beans alone can vary from **$0.22 to $0.84** per cup.

| Beans            | Bag Cost | Bag Size (g) | \# Cups | Cost per cup |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------------ | ------- | --------- |
| [Bulk](https://www.costco.com/san-francisco-french-roast-whole-bean-coffee-3-lb%2c-2-pack.product.100039943.html) | $ 39.99 | 2722 | 181.47 | $ 0.22 |
| [Starbucks x Costco]() | $ 22.99  | 1130         | 75.33   | $ 0.31    |
| [Grocery Brand]() | $ 10.00  | 340          | 22.67   | $ 0.44    |
| [Boutique]()         | $ 19.00  | 340          | 22.67   | $ 0.84    |

#### Margin on beans?
As a side note, after looking at the unit price of some of these deals I wonder what the margin on coffee beans is.  They must be pretty thin in some cases, right?.  For the 6 lbs of beans at $40, the cost per 15g of beans is $0.22 after all.

Some [quick googling](https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-margin-on-coffee-beans-from-roaster-to-distributor) is showing ~10% in some cases, but more details seem scarce.

Meaning the margin on these 340g-for-$19 beans is _quite_ boutique in comparison ($0.84 per cup vs $0.22 per cup).

### Extras
I drink my coffee with cream (yes, heavy cream) and sugar. And while the cost of sugar is negligible, the cost of the heavy cream is not.

A 236ml carton costs $2.49 and lasts about 8-10 cups, which comes out to **$0.31** per cup. That can be as much as the cost of the beans!

### Total
Add all of the pieces together and one cup of coffee comes out to **$0.91 to $1.53**.  (Surprisingly, the cost in equipment really spreads out over time, and the cost in beans can really drive up the total.)

That $4 cappuccino from Blue Bottle is not looking so egregious now, is it?

## Alternatives
I like the amount of control I get over various parts of the process with pour-over.  But there are tons of other ways to make coffee at home.  Some notable ones:

Graham Stephan's [$0.20 Iced Coffee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvL4FF2lMnw) - Graham uses a normal coffee machine and a much lower beans-to-cup ratio (~5g per cup to make 66 cups from a 340g bag).

[Cometeer](https://cometeer.com/how-we-make-it) - this company essentially sells liquid-nitrogen-frozen espresso shots you can store in your freezer, just add water or milk.  Interestingly, their frozen coffee pucks are $2 per serving, which makes them not that much more expensive than my pour-over setup.  Here's my [referral link](https://cometeer.com/products/pilot-program?code=57UJxv) if you want to give them a try.
