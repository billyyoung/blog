The US credit card game is a fun little optimization problem where the rewards can include free* travel, fancy hotel stays, and first-class flights.

Here's an example subproblem from the midgame.

## Downgrading my Chase Sapphire Reserve

### Why?
I'm paying to keep the [Reserve](https://creditcards.chase.com/rewards-credit-cards/sapphire/reserve) (or CSR) and I'm not getting enough value out of it for what I'm paying. And I can downgrade the card to a Freedom Flex which has no annual fee (meaning I can replace this expensive card with a no-cost one, without needing to cancel the card).

### Why not cancel the card?
In the US credit system, one metric your credit score is based on is Age of Oldest Account. Cancelling a credit card wipes out the history of that line of credit, which can hurt your credit score if it's your oldest account. So it's generally recommended to downgrade to a free card if you can (which keeps your line of credit alive), instead of cancelling your card.

### Why downgrade? (cont'd)
I think the CSR is still worth keeping if you have a lot of Chase Ultimate Rewards points ("UR points") or you have a lot of spend on Chase cards to generate UR points. And you're enjoying the card's other benefits.

In my case:

* My Effective Annual Fee is high

* I only have 20,000 UR points ($300-400 value for travel), which I plan to spend in the next few months

* I'm no longer generating a lot of UR points from regular spend (I'm using other cards for most categories I used to use the CSR for)

* I think a new big sign-up bonus offer for the CSP/CSR may be coming (80,000+ points?), and I'll be eligible for this since I'm past the [48-month rule](https://www.uponarriving.com/2021/03/18/chase-sapphire-48-month-rule-explained-2021/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Chase%20Sapphire%2048%20month%20rule%3F,into%20detail%20about%20the%20Sapphire%2048%20month%20rule.). So I'll be reapplying for one again anyway, if the sign-up bonus is worthwhile

### Number-crunching
#### Effective Annual Fee
CSR annual fee = -$550

Benefits I use = +$400

* $300 travel credit
* 10x on Lyft = ~$100 in value to me (see details below)
* <strike>Global Entry / TSA Pre / Nexus credit</strike> = $0, I've used this + I get this from other cards too
* <strike>Lounge access</strike> = $0, I get this from other cards too
* <strike>Travel and purchase protection</strike> = $0, I get this from other cards too
* <strike>Daordash dashpass + credits</strike> = $0, I don't order delivery

-> Effective Annual Fee = -$150

#### Categories and Spend

The CSR useful for:

* 3x on Restaurants
* 3x on Flights
* 3-10x on Ride-share, 3x on other misc travel (like car rentals)
* No foreign transaction fees
    * Pair this with 3x on Restaurants and this means 3x on dining internationally
    * As a Visa card, this is a good and safe option for international spend (vs say an AMEX that might not be accepted overseas)
* Chase UR portal means UR points are worth at minimum 1.5cpp (cents per point)
* Chase UR transfer partners (like Hyatt), where you can get ~2cpp


#### My lineup

| Category | Main Card | Points | | Backup | Points |
| :------------------------------------- | :---------------- | ----: | --- | :---- | --: |
| Dining                                 | AMEX Gold         |    4x |     | CSR   |  3x |
| Groceries                              | AMEX Gold         |    4x |     | -     |   - |
| Flights                                | AMEX Plat         |    5x |     | CSR   |  3x |
| Ride-share + car rental + other travel | CSR               | 3-10x |     | Hyatt | 2x* |
| International Dining                   | CSR               |    3x |     | Hyatt |  2x |
| Misc.⁺                                 | Freedom Unlimited |  1.5x |     | -     |   - |

*<small>Hyatt 2x only for ride-share</small>  
⁺<small>There's a few some subcategories and cards under "Misc." but rolling it all up into here for simplicity</small>

#### No Points
The only category I really use my CSR for now is Misc. Travel ("Ride-share + car rental + other travel"), where I'm spending at most $200 per month, or $2,400 per year. Points-wise, I'd estimate this generates 10,000 UR points annually (~4.17cpp).

I do also earn 1.5x UR points from my Freedom Unlimited for Misc. purchases. Let's say this is a generous $10,000 in spend annually, which means 15,000 UR points.

So that's maybe 25,000 UR points generated per year = $375-500 in value.

But there are alternatives for both Misc. Travel and Misc spend:

* My Hyatt card gets me 2x back on ride-share and commuting, so I'd earn 4,800 Hyatt points, which are roughly 1:1 with UR points (so I only really benefit from +5,200 UR points by using the CSR ~= $100)
* I can earn 1x back on Misc. spend -> for simplicity, let's also say this is also via Hyatt for 10,000 Hyatt points

Which means with other options, I still earn ~15,000 points = $225-$300 in value.

Factor in my plans to reapply for the CSR if/when a new big sign-up bonus offer comes along, and there's not much benefit for me to hang onto the card.

## The Game

I'll admit, all this number-crunching is effectively over some $100-$200.

But the credit card game runs deep if you want to play it, where you can have 5+ cards that _each_ give you some $500-$1000 in one-time sign-up bonuses, and $100-$200 in net value annually. Stack these up for a stay in the Maldives or a round trip first-class flight to Singapore paid with points.
