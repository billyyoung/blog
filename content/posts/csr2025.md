I wrote a <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/csr">post</a> in 2022 about the updates to the Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card. I thought that post was kind of cringe at the time, but lo and behold the credit card is <a target="_blank" href="https://media.chase.com/news/the-most-rewarding-cards-are-here">updating again</a> in 2025 and I went back to that post to reference some of the math. Who's cringe now??

So let's make another post.

Credit card basics, like "downgrade, don't cancel", are covered in the <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/csr">2022 post</a> so we'll skip those and get right into the meat.

## Effective Annual Fee
**CSR new annual fee = -$795**

**Benefits I use = +$420**
* $300 travel credit
* $120 monthly Lyft credit + 5x on Lyft

**Semi-fake or annoying-to-use benefits =** conservatively: **+$0**; optimistically: **+$300**
* $300 == $150 + $150[^1] dining credit for <a target="_blank" href="https://account.chase.com/sapphire/reserve/benefits#page-section-Dining">expensive restaurants</a>
* $300 == $150 + $150 Stubhub credit
* <a target="_blank" href="https://account.chase.com/sapphire-airport-lounge">Chase Sapphire Lounges</a> at airports (LGA, JFK, and others)

**→ My Effective Annual Fee = -$375 to -$75**

Benefits that I don't really care about = $0
* $500 == $250 + $250 The Edit credits, min 2-night stay
* $5 Doordash monthly food credit + dashpass
* Apple TV+ subscription
* IHG Platinum Elite status -- upgrades, early check-in, late check-out
* Everything else I don't care about and am not going to list out

## Categories and Multipliers

The CSR is useful for:

* 3x on Restaurants
* 4x on Flights and Hotels, booked direct (replaces 3x on all travel)
* 5x on Lyft
* No foreign transaction fees
    * Pair this with 3x on Restaurants and this means 3x on dining internationally
    * As a Visa card, this is a good and safe option for international spend (vs say AMEX that is less accepted overseas)
* Ultimate Rewards (UR) transfer partners (like Hyatt), where you can get ~2cpp (cents per point)
* New UR periodic redemption promos where you can get 2cpp (actual usefulness unclear)
* UR points earned before Oct 26, 2025 can still be redeemed at 1.5cpp for any travel, until <a target="_blank" href="https://media.chase.com/news/the-most-rewarding-cards-are-here">Oct 26, 2027</a>

### My card lineup

| Category | Main Card | Points | | Backup | Points |
| :------------------------------------- | :---------------- | ----: | --- | :---- | --: |
| Dining in US                           | AMEX Gold         |    4x |     | CSR   |  3x |
| Dining interntational                  | **CSR**           |    3x |     | Hyatt |  2x |
| Groceries                              | AMEX Gold         |    4x |     | -     |   - |
| Flights                                | AMEX Plat         |    5x |     | CSR   |  4x |
| Uber                                   | AMEX Plat         |   1x* |     | Hyatt |  2x |
| Lyft                                   | **CSR**           |    5x |     | Hyatt |  2x |
| Public transit                         | Hyatt             |    2x |     | -     |   - |
| Car rentals                            | **CSR**           |   1x⁺ |     | Plat  | 1x⁺ |
| Airbnb, misc travel                    | Freedom Unlimited |  1.5x |     | -     |   - |
| Everything else                        | Freedom Unlimited |  1.5x |     | -     |   - |

*<small>Uber needs to be paid on an AMEX card to make use of my $25 monthly credits from AMEX Plat and Gold.</small>  
⁺<small>CSR I think still has the best rental car insurance coverage, so we want to use it here. Plat is the next best.</small>  

## Final thoughts
The math here on value boils down to:  
* How many of those iffy credits can I actually use? (without uncharacteristic spending)
* How many points do I actually generate from my CSR and Freedom Unlimited?
* How much value can I get from points redemptions / transfer partners?

The CSR for me right now is mainly a Hyatt / transfer partners machine, now made more expensive.

Not sure what I'm going to do yet, but eating a nearly $400 effective annual fee would be pretty bad.

[^1]: $N + $N format denotes that you get $N back on transactions in Jan-Jun, and $N back for Jul-Dec. Hence annoying. (<a target="_blank" href="https://account.chase.com/sapphire/reserve/benefits">source; ctrl+F '$150'</a>)
