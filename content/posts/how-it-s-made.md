* fix intro
* cleanup step 3
* more gotchas?
* add some feedback/CTA at the end via email/twitter

Writing, to me, is like singing.  I create something for myself, and yet I also want it to be heard.  It's personal --- made up of bits of me and my emotions.  And I feel responsible to leave it all on the stage (or page), otherwise what's the point?  


(intro: what I'm doing, why)
two nuggets of wisdom related to writing
- be prolific as f*ck - visa
- do only what you can do - naval

I've wanted to "start writing" for years now --- to discover and develop my voice, and hopefully be helpful to some people along the way.
But I was my own worst enemy (I still am) --- I used excuses like lack of time and energy, work, pride, and perfectionism to keep myself comfortable.  

It's only recently, through interacting with those who do write a lot, that I've found the perspective shift and encouragement to strike out on my own.

I settled on a personal site.  This is how it's made:

## #goals
I started by deciding on my goals and requirements.  This would inform how I would build things and what tools I would use.

**My goals:** get something minimal up and running, and be able to build an audience (see David Perell's [guide to writing online](https://www.perell.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-online)).  

This meant having the following as part of my "Minimum Viable Blog":

* A clean and minimal design
* A [Start Here](/start-here) page, with some personal details
* A [Links](/links) page, with some recommended content while I prepare my own work
* A way to measure traffic
* A mailing list people can subscribe to

I also wanted to be able to:

* Easily draft and publish posts
* Host and deploy my site with low effort
* Not have to write all of the HTML/CSS from scratch
* But still be able to customize some HTML/CSS myself if necessary
* Have a cool domain name

To accomplish this, I ended up choosing a combination of **Hugo** (to generate the static site content) and **GitHub Pages** (to host the content).

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is an open-source framework used to generate static websites.  You can pick an open-source theme from their [list](https://themes.gohugo.io/) or create your own (this site uses the [Ezhil](https://themes.gohugo.io/ezhil/) theme), write your posts in Markdown, and use the Hugo command-line tool to generate all of the static HTML and CSS files.  Most themes also have built-in support for Google Analytics so you can track traffic and page views.

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) lets you host a website directly from a GitHub repository.  With this, I can just push the static files generated by Hugo to my GitHub Pages repository to deploy updates to my site.

## #work
After deciding on my toolkit, I took these steps to get from concept to launch:

1. Set up a minimal site using GitHub Pages  
2. Configure a custom domain and make the site accessible from it
3. Set up Hugo to generate the site content 
4. The "Minimum Viable Blog"
5. Launch!

I also ran into a couple gotchas, which I've included at the end.

### Step 1/5: Set up a minimal site using GitHub Pages  
_**Goals:** prep to set up a custom domain in Step 2 and draft content in Step 3_

The instructions on the [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) landing page were actually pretty clear, so I followed those to create my _user site_. 

It was accessible right away via <a>\<username\>.github.io</a>.  Hello World!

### Step 2/5: Configure a custom domain  
_**Goals:** branding and clout_  

I could finally put my domain squatting to use! And who doesn't want a cool domain name in 2019?  

I followed more GitHub Pages [documentation](https://help.github.com/en/articles/quick-start-setting-up-a-custom-domain) to configure my custom domain.  The steps break down into:  

* Register a domain on your preferred platform/DNS Provider
  * e.g. I'm using [Google Domains](https://domains.google/)
* [Add](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-or-removing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) your custom domain for your GitHub Pages site
* Set up your custom domain with your DNS Provider  
  * Note: this differs depending on what URL format you want for your domain
  * e.g. <a>billy.dev</a>, <a>www.billy.dev</a>, <a>blog.billy.dev</a>
  * For my apex domain (<a>billy.dev</a>), this is what my DNS settings look like:
  * \<TODO insert img\>

After doing all of that (and waiting an hour or so for the DNS updates to propagage), <a>billy.dev</a> was live!

### Step 3/5: Set up Hugo  

TODO

* [Follow](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) Hugo's quick start guide
* Choose a theme
  * [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the repo in GitHub so you can modify it if necessary
  * e.g. so you can add a "Subscribe" form in the [footer](https://github.com/billyyoung/ezhil/blob/master/layouts/partials/footer.html) in Step 4
* Set up configs
  * blackfriday, href blank (TODO)
  * rss for Step 4

To test: (TODO)

### Step 4/5: The "Minimum Viable Blog"
_Goals: immediately start building an audience based on your taste_

(Recommended) [Read](https://www.perell.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-online) David Perell's guide to writing online.  

* Write a bio for a Start Here page
* Curate a list of articles for a Links page
* Set up Google Analytics (GA)
  * [Create](https://analytics.google.com) a GA account (or [follow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXcQ7rVn3ro) this video if you don't want to think)
  * Add your GA Tracking ID to your Hugo config.toml file

#### Set up an email list  
This gets its own section because of the amount of effort required.  

**Rent a PO Box**  
To set up an email list in the US, you are required by [law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN-SPAM_Act_of_2003) to provide a valid mailing address when creating an account on your email marketing platform of choice.  You are also required to **display** this address to all subscribers of your email list.  Yikes.  Fortunately, you can rent a PO Box to use here instead:

* [Reserve](https://www.usps.com/manage/po-boxes.htm) a PO Box at a local USPS Post Office
  * For reference, my PO Box in SF costs $140/year to rent
* Visit the USPS Post Office in person to activate your rental
  * Note: you'll need to bring (1) photo ID and (1) **non-**photo ID proof of address  
(so a Passport + driver's license will not work)

**Actually set up your email list**  
I use Mailchimp to manage my email list.  

* [Create](https://login.mailchimp.com/signup/) a Mailchimp account
* [Set up](https://mailchimp.com/help/create-audience/) a Mailchimp Audience
* [Add](https://mailchimp.com/help/add-a-signup-form-to-your-website/) a signup form to your site
  * e.g. in your website [footer](https://github.com/billyyoung/ezhil/commit/e67828d1ad97d1346c1739f78734153d150af7db)
* [Create](https://mailchimp.com/help/share-your-blog-posts-with-mailchimp/) an email campaign for your posts
  * Use your RSS feed URL from Step 3
* [Format](https://mailchimp.com/help/design-an-email-campaign-in-mailchimp/) your email campaign template

### Step 5/5: Launch!
And now the real writing challenges begin...

### Bonus: Gotchas
