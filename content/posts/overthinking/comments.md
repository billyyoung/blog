I like my static HTML generator blog. It’s slick, it’s lightweight, I think it’s cute. I can render it on my local without an internet connection and write posts on airplanes like I'm doing with this one.

But one thing this blog doesn’t have is a (nice and easy way to set up a) comments section.[^1]
[^1]: And I like the amount of control I have over things far too much to move to, say, Substack which provides this for you

But also, who tf is even reading this blog lol such that there would be a lively comments section. Why am I worried about this at this stage of this product?

Because of what it symbolizes, what it _could_ lead to: responses, discussion, Being Perceived.

But also, if people really did want to reach out and chat about a post, they'd find me, friction be damned.

I don’t think a comments section is really consequential right now, it’s just an ego insecurity thing. We’ll deal with it if/when it becomes a problem.

And actually a better avenue to Being Perceived is to just post more, and increase my surface area that way.
