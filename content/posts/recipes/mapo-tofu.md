* 6-8 cloves of garlic, minced -- _yes that many_
* 2+ tbsp <a target="_blank" href="https://usa.lkk.com/en/products/chili-bean-sauce">spicy douban jiang</a>
* 1/4 tsp ground sichuan peppercorn, or 2 tsp whole sichuan peppercorns
* 1 cup low sodium chicken broth, or water
* Light soy sauce, dark soy sauce
* Shaoxing wine -- _ideal to maximize flavour, but not mandatory_ 
* Chinkiang black vinegar -- _ideal to maximize flavour, but not mandatory_ 
* Corn starch + water
* (optional) 1/4 tsp sugar
* (optional) 1-2 dried chile de arbol, cut into 1" slices and deseeded -- _if you want it spicier_

Finish with
* 2 scallions, diced
* sesame oil

## Directions
Prep
* Mince your **ginger** using the <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/KRrsifp2FpA?si=-cgzVLiQ5_zQ33NX&t=150">smashing technique</a>
* Mince your **garlic** using the smashing technique or a garlic press
* Cut your **tofu** into cubes
* If using **whole sichuan peppercorns**, grind them down to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle
    * _If you're a try-hard: remove any shiny black seeds in your peppercorns before grinding. Apparently these are very bitter, I wouldn't know, I've always removed them._
* In a bowl, make your **corn starch slurry** with 1 tsp corn starch + 1 tbsp water

Cooking
* Recommend using a saute pan or dutch oven for surface area and height
* Brown your **meat** --> a good initial sear is enough, and meat should be fully cooked by the end
* Drain however much excess rendered fat you'd like using a paper towel, leaving some fat to fry the rest of the ingredients
* Add in the 2 tbsp **douban jiang** --> fry it a bit to heat it up and extract some of its oil
* Stir in the minced **ginger**, minced **garlic**, and **arbols** if using --> fry for 30-60s or until fragrant
* Stir in the **ground sichuan peppercorn** --> fry for ~30s (DO NOT LET THIS BURN)
* Add in the 1 cup **chicken stock** or water + 2 tbsp **shaoxing wine**
* Add 1/2 tbsp **light soy** + 1/2 tbsp **dark soy**, plus more to taste
* Add 1/4 tsp **sugar**, plus more to taste, if using
* Bring this to a simmer
* Add in 2 tsp **black vinegar**, if using
* Stir in **corn starch slurry**
* Stir in **tofu** --> let the tofu warm up and let the slurry thicken everything, 3-5 mins
* Finish with **scallions** and **sesame oil**, and serve with rice
