_From some instagram recipe I lost the link to._

Total time: 20 mins + 60 mins bake + 3h fridge

## Special equipment
* 3 ramekins or oven-safe small coffee mugs
* Loaf pan or baking dish, that can fit the ramekins and be filled with water to reach at least 1/3 up the ramekins
* Nice to have: 2-cup glass measuring cup

## Ingredients
Makes 3 servings
* 3 bags earl grey tea (ideally decaf for this late night dessert)
* 1/4 cup heavy cream
* 1 cup whole milk
* 2 egg yolks
* 1/4 cup brown sugar
* 3oz chocolate, chopped
  * Recommended: a mix of dark + semisweet
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* Tiny pinch of salt

Optional: fresh whipped cream, for serving

## Directions
* Preheat oven to 325°F
* In a saucepan - heat **milk** and **cream** until just before boiling
  * ~180F, or when you start to see wisps of steam or individual bubbles appearing
* Remove from heat and add **tea bags**, infuse for 5 mins
* While waiting, chop **chocolate** and set aside
* Remove tea bags to a bowl, use a spoon to squeeze out any remaining liquid
* Add chocolate to warm milk, whisk until melted and combined
* Add a pinch of salt to milk mixture
* Prep "final bowl" that will eventually hold everything -- ideally a 2-cup glass measuring cup, or a metal bowl
* In "final bowl" - whisk together **egg yolks** and **brown sugar**
* In "final bowl" - temper in the chocolate mixture into eggs
* Add vanilla extract
* Pour mixture into ramekins
* Tent ramekins with foil
* Put ramekins in loaf pan or baking dish, and fill with hot water at least 1/3 up the ramekins
* Bake at 325°F for ~55-60 mins, until firm on the outside while jiggly in the center
* Remove and refrigerate for at least 3-4 hours, ideally overnight (the longer the better)
