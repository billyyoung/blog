_Adapted from Carla Lalli Music's recipe on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XE3cAz8kG0">youtube</a> and in her cookbook <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/That-Sounds-So-Good-Real-Life/dp/0593138252">That Sounds So Good</a>._

Total time: 40 mins

## Ingredients
Makes 2 servings
* 1 steak
* 3 anchovy fillets packed in oil
* 1 garlic clove
* 1 lemon
* 1 heaping tbsp greek yogurt, or more
* 1 heaping tbsp mayonnaise, or more
* Salt & pepper
* Arugula*  
<small>*You can also use mixed greens instead, but IMO the bitterness of the arugula is key to the dish</small>

Finish with
* Parmigiano reggiano, shaved
* (Optional) Crushed mixed nuts

## Directions

Steak
* For a **cold steak salad** as the original recipe intends: cook steak before you make the dressing so it has a chance to cool down a bit

Dressing
* In a mortar and pestle - smash your **anchovy** and **garlic** with a touch of kosher salt to form a paste
  * You can also just chop everything fine with a knife, but a mortar and pestle make this super easy
* Transfer **paste** to a bowl big enough to house the final dressing
* Zest and juice 1/2 the **lemon**, and add it to the paste
  * Use the remaining lemon to adjust the acidity at the end, to your taste
* Add in the **greek yogurt** and **mayo**; you can adjust the ratio and amounts to your liking
* Salt & pepper to taste
* Dressing should be _very assertive_

Assembly
* In a huge salad bowl - spoon the dressing on the sides of the bowl to coat
* Toss in salad greens
* Slice steak, and toss in
* Crush nuts, and toss in, if using
* Give everything a big mix, adding more dressing directly to the salad as needed
* Finish with freshly shaved parm and more black pepper
