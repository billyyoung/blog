## Ingredients

Garam Masala
* 1 tbsp cumin seeds
* 1 tbsp coriander seeds
* 4 black cardamom pods
* 1 tsp fenugreek seeds
* 1/2 tsp black peppercorns
* 1/2 cinnamon stick

Chicken
* 5 lbs chicken drumsticks
* 2 tbsp kashmiri chili powder
* 2-3 tbsp ginger garlic paste, from the jar or freshly made
* Juice of 1 lemon
* 1/2 cup greek yogurt
* Salt

(Optional) Vegetable side
* 1 white onion
* 1-2 green bell peppers
* Lemon juice

## Directions
Garam Masala
* (Optional) Toast spices in a pan, until fragrant and just smoking
* Grind them into a powder, using a spice grinder

Marination
* Score **chicken** drums with several deep cuts each, and place in your marinating vessel (ideally plastic, glass, or stainless steel b/c acid)
* Salt chicken, eyeballing how much salt you'd need to fully season the meat
* Add in **garam masala**, getting a good coating (you won't use all of it)
* Add in **ginger garlic paste**, **lemon juice**, and **yogurt**
* Mix until each piece is coated in a homogenous paste
* Cover, and marinate overnight

Cook
* Preheat broiler on its hottest setting
* Line baking sheet with foil and wire rack, and place chicken
* Broil chicken as close as you can to the element until charred, about 10 mins
  * If things are charring too quickly, get your char and then continue broiling on a lower rack position, as chicken meat will still need more time to cook
* Flip chicken, and repeat broiling process to char the other side, about 10 mins
  * If the drippings start to burn, add some water to the baking sheet
* Check chicken temp -- if <170F, get chicken up to temp by baking at 350F

Vegetable side
* Peel and slice veges
* Toss in oil, salt
* Roast, or pan fry, till browned but still with some bite
* Finish with some lemon juice
