After two years, my sabbatical has come to an end; I've started a Clinical Psychology grad program to become a therapist.

The timeline since my last sabbatical post looks something like this:

**Nov 2024**  
Got the itch to do something work/career-related again. Pondered the idea of <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/sabbatical-notes/9/">Good Work</a>.

**Dec 2024**  
Decided to apply to "therapist school" - Counseling Psychology (MA) and Clinical Psychology (PsyD) programs. I thought, "F*ck it, I'll apply. If I don't get in, then we'll figure out what to do after."

**Jan 2025**  
Crammed grad school applications.

Plus started pre-req classes for the PsyD programs I was applying to, (1) in case I got in, and (2) as an experiment to see if going back to school would make me want to bash my head into a wall or not.

**Feb 2025**  
Conflict! With all of the applications and coursework, I started to yearn for the earlier, freer days of my sabbatical when I just did whatever I wanted.
Wrestled with <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/sabbatical-notes/10/">indecision</a>. Did I really want to go to grad school? Should I just stay on sabbatical and see where that wandering route leads?

**Mar 2025**  
I decided to commit to the grad school path: I would apply AND if I didn't get in, I would apply again in the next cycle. I was going to to school.

I talk about this more in my <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/sabbatical-notes/10/">indecision post</a>, but essentially at a meta level it was important for me to choose 'focus' -- to make _a_ decision and see it through until it no longer serves me. And I picked the option that was harder to come by and more time-sensitive (grad school). I could always go on another sabbatical later.

**End of Mar 2025**  
I got accepted to my top choice PsyD program. Wild.

**Apr-Jun 2025**  
Reoriented my life around attending grad school in the Fall. I had projects I needed to wrap up â€“ sabbatical notes to write to capture my thoughts and feelings, other blog posts, meeting with an interior designer about how to update my living room. I bought an e-bike for my new commute, and did a test ride where I got a flat tire and had to get it fixed ðŸ˜….

**Jul-Aug 2025**  
Lots of summer plans â€“ shows, friends, family, travel.

Lots of scratching items off my weeb bucket list. Went to an Ado concert (I am still thinking about <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zh5i3x7CZ0">her cover of Chandelier</a>). Blitzed a trip to NYC to see the Hololive EN concert.[^1]

Sabbatical complete!

**Aug-Oct 2025**  
Started grad school. Got thrown into the deep end but with some support structures, which is kind of how I prefer to learn. It's been a lot, but it really feels like there's no place I'd rather be right now.

It's crazy how fun and engaging school and training can be when you're really into the subject.
