It's been just over one year now since I went on sabbatical, and I wanted to write some sort of "Year One" update post. But what I **didn't** want to happen was for me to get stuck making something Serious or Formal in order to Properly celebrate the milestone. So here I am, writing something quick and loose so I can just get something out into the world.

A quick summary of my one year on sabbatical:

* <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/new-game-plus/">Quit my job of 7y cus I was burnt out</a>
* <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/sabbatical-notes/1-doing/">Wanted to get working on side hustles ASAP</a>
* <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/sabbatical-notes/2-fun/">Realized I wasn't allowing myself to have fun</a>, or do anything I didn't view as "productive"
* Realized this came from <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/emptiness/">me wanting external validation</a> for being productive, and wanting to be seen as Good
* <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/sabbatical-notes/recap1/">Reconnected with my sense of Fun</a>, and only did projects I found Fun for a while
* Realized I wanted my next job to be The Thing that will fulfill me (<a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/sabbatical-notes/4/#big-magic">spoiler: that's not how it works</a>)
* <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/sabbatical-notes/5/">Realized I did not like myself → I wanted to fix this</a>
* <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/love-the-grind/">Rebuilt my connection to Fun</a>, and my started building a new sense of self-love
* Realized I kinda need to <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/sabbatical-notes/7/">relearn how to be happy</a>, in the unique ways I need
* Found affinity with the concept of _puruṣārtha_, especially _dharma_ and _moksha_
* Reached my <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/what-you-like#motto">current motto</a>: **Nurture your harmony. Take care of yourself. Build what you enjoy building, and eventually do it in community.**

Next up: try to create a job for myself where I can do ^ and also help others.

## Extended rambles
(1) A reminder to make time for yourself. I am very thankful that I had the means to go on a break for this long and continue on this break. All this time and space was, I think, necessary for my inclination to dig to take hold and make such meaningful progress. The more space I seem to have, the more I dig, and the more I build.

(2) As for the long term, so far the concept of _puruṣārtha_ has been very resonant and attractive as, to use video game lingo, a possible late-game build. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/AiXiyLJz8-U?si=6xyx24hx9mBEjcNG&t=1447">This video</a> is what first put me onto the idea, if you want to learn more.

(3) Have I recovered from my burnout? Idk. When I think of going back to a software eng job I still get the heebie jeebies, just a little bit. But I could probably go back now and do it sustainably by keeping true to my updated values. I'm also still making things and trying to craft a bespoke life for myself that eventually includes making money again (maybe as soon as a couple months from now), which to me is a sign of someone who is at least on the up-and-up. We'll see though.
