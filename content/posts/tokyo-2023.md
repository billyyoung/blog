_Here's the 2023 update to my [2019 Tokyo recs](https://billy.dev/posts/tokyo-2019/)._

## Logistics before  

**Flights**  
There are two airports you can fly to: Haneda airport (HND) and Narita airport (NRT).  
I’d recommend HND over NRT if you have the choice.

HND is closer to Tokyo (45 mins to 1h for ~¥600 by subway) vs NRT (1h to 1.5h for ~¥3,500 by NRT Express + subway).

**Getting around Japan (prep version)**  
If you’ll be in Japan for over 7 days and plan to take the Shinkansen (high speed trains) between Tokyo, Kyoto/Osaka, and beyond, look into getting the **JR Pass**.

This pass includes rides on the Shinkansen (non-express lines), as well as the JR subway lines in Tokyo. You can still ride the trains/metro without a JR Pass by paying directly, but buying the pass will likely save you some money in the end.

You can order the JR Pass online to either be shipped to you beforehand, or to be picked up at the airport (~1h line). They come in 7/14/21-day options.

**Stay**  
I’d recommend staying in Shinjuku, one of the most populous areas, where you'll find lots of restaurants, malls/shops, and subway stops nearby.  Shibuya is another area that's good for the same reasons, though central Shibuya and the famous Shibuya Scramble Crossing can feel a bit like Times Square with the crowds, so I prefer it less. 

For lodging, Airbnbs look to be much cheaper than hotels (30%+ cheaper), especially for longer stays. But Airbnbs can be a bit hit-or-miss with things like: mattress quality or only having Japanese floor futons, your A/C's ability to fight off the Japanese summer humidity, and noise (the Airbnb we stayed at was next to an elementary school so there was a lot of activity in the mornings). YMMV.

**Internet and Phone**  
If you're traveling alone, you can purchase a data SIM card at the airport for some reasonable price (I didn't do this so idk the exact numbers).

You can also purchase a data e-SIM beforehand via a service like [ubigi.com](https://ubigi.com/), which runs you around $17 for 10GB over 30 days (data only). 

If you're traveling in a group, there's also the option to get a Pocket Wi-fi–essentially a portable mobile hotspot device–which you can order ahead online for pick-up/drop-off at the airport. On my 2023 trip, I ordered one from [Ninja WiFi](https://ninjawifi.com/en/) which got me 3GB per day, at $65 for 14 days (so ~$5 USD / day).

## Logistics when you're there  

**Getting around Tokyo**  
May Google Maps guide you.

The subway system in Tokyo is extremely robust (with all signs translated in EN too) and reaches all popular areas. I got around mainly by subway, or walking short distances. I took the bus once, which was smooth too (and also had EN translations).

If you don’t have a JR pass, you can get a metro card at the airport or any subway station (an "IC card", from either PASSMO or SUICA brands, but they function the same) or via the SUICA app, and load money onto it (cash only). This lets you ride any subway line in Tokyo (whereas the JR Pass which only lets you ride free on JR lines).

Subway fares are usually ~¥200-300 one way.

**Money**  
Japan is still a very cash-heavy country, with many small shops and restaurants not accepting credit cards (larger establishments likely will though).

Metro cards are also only loadable by cash, and if you're out and about a lot expect to spend ~¥1,000 per day on the subway. (Pro-tip: there are unlimited use day-passes for within Tokyo for ¥900 that you can buy at the machine and load onto your card. Or consider even getting a monthly pass if you're going to be there for more than 14d, it was priced at ~¥17,500 IIRC.)

For reference: on my 2023 trip I exchanged ~$400 USD over my 14-day trip, mainly spent on the metro and restaurants/food stalls.

On exchanging currency:  

* Kinda obvious but worth mentioning: check the exchange rate on Google ("usd to yen") and try to get as close to that as you can anytime you exchange currency
* Airport rates are actually pretty good, so don't hesitate to exchange currency at the airport
* In the city, the best rate I saw was at this [Interbank](https://www.interbank.co.jp/) shop near Shinjuku station (~1% off). There are also local currency exchange shops in hubs like Shinjuku and Shibuya that can be hit or miss in efficiency (~5% off), and then there are Travelex's which had the worst rates I saw (~10% off)
* 7 BANK ATMs (similar logo to 7-ELEVEN, but these ATMs can also be found in malls) are worth mentioning as a last last resort. You can withdraw yen from your bank account via your debit card, but US banks will hit you with a $5 fee + 3% foreign exchange fee, which makes your effective exchange rate like 10% worse


**Searching restaurants**  
You can look up restaurants on Google Maps, though beware the ratings and reviews will mostly be from foreigners.

**Pro-tip**: to find less tourist-y places, pick the type of restaurant/food you want (e.g. yakitori), get the japanese translation (e.g. yakitori = 焼き鳥), and search _that_ in Google Maps. Restaurants with "yakitori" in their name have Westernized their names for Google for better tourist SEO (which maybe doesn't actually signal anything in regards to quality though, idk).

To see more local ratings and reviews, try [Tabelog](https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/) (though FYI, at a glance it looks like Japanese people are rate more harshly on average). Tabelog also has better details on what phone number to call to make reservations.

**Restaurant reservations**  
One downside of data SIMs or pocket Wi-fis is that you won't have a phone number, which is frustratingly useful in Japan mostly for calling restaurants or services to make reservations. So if you're trying to dine at fancy restaurants that need reservations, consider getting a SIM that has calling capabilities. Normal restaurants do take walk-ins though.

Alternatives to having a phone number are:  

* If you're staying at a hotel, you can ask the hotel concierge to call the restaurant to make a reservation for you
* Some restaurants are contactable by LINE (the primary messaging app in Japan), so try via LINE (would also recommend downloading the app and making an account beforehand)
* If you're extroverted enough and make friends with a Japanese person and get their contact info, they may be able to help make reservations for you at their favourite places

**Laundry**  
Japanese apartments (and therefore Airbnbs) will commonly have a washer but no dryer, and you dry your clothes on the patio or on hanging rods inside the room. But in the summer when it's humid, it might take clothes a couple of days to air-dry, depending on your place.

Alternatively, we found some coin laundromats near us that were fairly cheap and convenient, where we'd pop our laundry in in the morning and go to a cafe for some coffee while we waited.

* For washing: ¥200 for cold water or ¥300 for warm water, for a 30 min cycle
* For drying: ¥100 for 10 mins, and 20 mins was usually enough for things like t-shirts and socks

## Districts

My recommendations:

* **Daikanyama & Nakameguro:** Two districts right next to each other that I’d definitely recommend visiting. **Daikanyama** is a beautifully hip area full of cool clothing stores and small winding roads. Check out the Tsutaya bookstore and the unique Starbucks located inside. **Nakameguro** is right along the Meguro River which is [stunning](https://www.instagram.com/p/BSe7IQMhc0H/) during cherry blossom season, and is lined with various cute shops for food/clothing/accessories. The Tokyo [Starbucks Reserve Roastery](https://www.starbucksreserve.com/en-us/locations/tokyo) is also here
* **Harajuku:** Mostly for walking and beholding IMO (actual shopping is covered next). Stroll through [Takeshita-dori Street](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g1066456-d1373790-Reviews-Takeshita_Street-Shibuya_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html) in Harajuku, a crazy dense street lined with cool shops, and people-watch. If you're into shrines and trees, visit Meiji Jingu
* **Omotesando & Ura-Harajuku:** Right next to Harajuku is **Omotensando**. This is Shopping Central for your more typical retail experience; find your global brands and Japanese brands here, as well as the popular [kaleidoscope escalator](https://www.pursuitofart.com/blog/kaleidoscopic-mirrored-escalator-tokyo-plaza-omotesando-harajuku). Then go to "**Ura-hara**" (meaning "behind Harajuku") to shop some lauded but kinda secret local brands (see "Shopping" section below)
* **Shinjuku:** My favourite place to walk around. A bustling area with tons of restaurants, shops, malls, and arcades
* **Shibuya:** Mainly for the famous Shibuya Crossing. There are also a lot of stores and restaurants in the area. If you're into luxury thrift shopping, check out the two [Kindals](https://www.kind.co.jp/) here
* **Asakusa:** Visit [Sensoji Temple](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3001.html) and the shops that precede it. Check out [Sokichi](https://goo.gl/maps/5FNPoL85dXAvVDiG6), a shop that sells beautiful [edo-kiriko](https://kogeijapan.com/locale/en_US/edokiriko/)-style sake cups and other glassware, if you're into that sort of thing. Grab lunch at Namiki Yabusoba (see "Food" section below). The Uniqlo in Asakusa also offers their custom print and embroidery service, and is supposedly faster than the Ginza store (I ordered a couple shirts to be embroidered that were ready at noon the next day)
* **Tokyo Skytree:** 1 stop after Asakusa. Would recommend going for the view, and marvelling at just how huge Tokyo is
* **Ginza:** Like 5th Avenue in NYC, with all the luxury brand stores. Visit the massive 12-floor Uniqlo flagship store, especially for their sweet exclusive t-shirt and tote bag designs. There are also a bunch of good restaurants in Ginza
* **Akihabara:** Anime, trading cards, electronics, and what I call "maid zombies". Visit Animate for the latest anime releases and merch, and Mandarake for secondhand manga and other paraphernalia. For secondhand anime figurines, the prices can vary wildly between stores – I’d recommend looking at shops that are farther away from Akihabara Station, like TRADERS. For new figures, check out AmiAmi (or DM me if you want any tips 😛). Arcades here are pretty crowded so I prefer going to the ones in Shinjuku or Shibuya instead. Also, a depressing number of girls in maid outfits line the main streets soliciting for the maid cafes that employ them (it was like 5x less in 2019, I swear)

### Tsukiji Market
This one gets its own subsection. Beware: a lot of the shops are closed on Wednesdays so plan accordingly.

This used to be where they held live tuna auctions every morning around 3 AM–those have since moved to [Toyosu Fish Market](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3013_market.html), but the restaurants and shops that buy and serve the fish are still here. 

I’d recommend getting here around 7:30-8 AM to check out some of the open shops and get a lay of the land before finding a sit-down place for an early lunch.

My must-have recommendations:

* Tamagoyaki (JP egg omelette, sweet and savoury) at the main stand (there are a few so make sure you find the right one) - line should be minimal at ~8AM, gets crazy later in the day
* Strawberry daifuku (mochi) - the best mochi I've ever had
* Fresh oyster and/or sashimi, with ponzu

Some other popular options if you're into them:

* Unagi skewer and/or A5 wagyu beef skewer
* Seafood stand that serves crab sashimi, and grilled scallops
* This one stand that serves organ stew over rice
* Matcha or Hojicha latte at [Matcha Stand Maruni](https://goo.gl/maps/PK3nY5LwBW1KZMRy6) (opens 9AM, there's usually a line)

Then line up for an early lunch. I'd recommend lining up at these spots, 45 mins to 1h before they open:

* [Seagen](https://goo.gl/maps/58Go9LhgKPUYy8Rj7) (opens 10AM) - tuna
* [Sushikuni](https://goo.gl/maps/HGArGtFPYaeUQK22A) (opens 10AM) - uni, cash only
* [Yaku Uo Ishikawa](https://goo.gl/maps/ErkmWmMv666Enu2y7) (opens 11AM) - tuna, raw and grilled
* (This is also a great time for someone in your group to grab Matcha Stand Maruni while you wait)

There are also tons of good TikToks/Insta Reels that cover how to enjoy Tsukiji efficiently, so check those out for the visuals and to get some more ideas. 

## Food
Here are the places I ate at over my few trips that I would recommend. Most have English menus, unless otherwise stated, and take credit card, unless otherwise stated.

### Ramen
Generally considered affordable fast food and late night food in Japan. Here are the few spots that are worth seeking out.

* **[Nakiryu](https://www.thetravelmentor.com/2019/05/nakiryu-michelin-star-tantanmen-ramen-tokyo-japan/) (Minami-Otsuka):** Michelin-star ramen restaurant; very very good, worth the trek. Vegetarian-friendly (I think). This place opens at 11 AM and only seats 10, so the line gets long. I’d recommend lining up before they open – I went ~30 mins before on a weekday morning and was seated in the 2nd batch and got out by 12 PM. Order by vending machine (cash).
* **[Tsuta](https://www.thewholeworldisaplayground.com/how-to-eat-tsuta-tokyo-michelin-star-ramen/) (Sugamo):** Michelin-star soba restaurant; very very good, worth the trek (and absolutely not like any of the global expansion locations, like in SF which is awful). Vegetarian-friendly (I think). To eat here, you need to first buy a ticket to secure the time slot of your seating (first-come first-serve, for 11-12, 12-1, or 1-2). I’d recommend buying a ticket around 8 AM for an 11 AM seating. Order by vending machine (cash).
* **[Ramen nagi](https://goo.gl/maps/RZdigPAMRGkPk8iP6) (Shinjuku):** Get some rare Niboshi Ramen (anchovy-based broth), though not worth lining up more than 30 mins for IMO. Order by vending machine (cash).
* **Ichiran (chain):** Reliable 7.5/10 ramen, every time; though not worth lining up more than 20 mins for IMO. Vegetarian-friendly (I think). Order via vending machine (cash).

### Other Noodles

* **\*STRONG REC\* [Tsukemen Gonokami Seisakuso](https://goo.gl/maps/eZNwnJXAy1BZ7Z5z5) (Shinjuku):** The noodles I still think about regularly. Delicious shrimp tsukemen (dipping noodles) near Shinjuku Station. Go at least 15 mins before they open on a weekday morning. Order by vending machine (cash).
* **[Namiki Yabusoba](https://goo.gl/maps/pGQDqmRFgGbpagbF7) (Asakusa):** Soba restaurant recommended by our chef at Sushi Yuu, where his family has been dining at since his great-grandparents' time. Solid; would recommend the hot or cold tempura soba.

### Seafood
* **\*STRONG REC\* [Tsujihan](https://goo.gl/maps/9gmdCVVxXjepUy7G8) (Nihombashi):** Trendy/hyped luxurious seafood rice bowl that is worth the wait. Go 1h before they open, or at an off-hour like 3 PM (though expect a 30min+ wait still). This is the main branch, and other branches in the city might have smaller lines though YMMV. Cash only.
* **\*STRONG REC\* [Kanemasu](https://goo.gl/maps/w3jfthdtJAizZv7F9) (Kachidoki):** This 12-person standing-bar-service-only restaurant is an absolute hidden gem. Really fresh and exquisite seafood dishes. I’d highly recommend the crab salad, and the wagyu + uni dish. No English menu, but I was able to show them [pictures](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g1066444-d11909267-Reviews-Kanemasu-Chuo_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html) on my phone of what I wanted to order. Cash only.
* **[Tsunahachi](https://goo.gl/maps/cm3xpQAb3Q6ZDqPV8) (Shinjuku):** Tempura restaurant with various prix fixe and à la carte options for seafood, fish, and vegetables. Their anago (freshwater eel) tempura is insane. Reservation likely not needed, but it can get busy.

### Sushi
* **[Sushi Yuu](https://goo.gl/maps/G4Y2kURrp8st3wcd8) (Nishiazabu):** Omakase sushi with Daisuke-san, the stellar chef and host who speaks English. My prior SF vs Tokyo omakase experiences have been pretty close, so I wasn't seeking out omakase in Tokyo again, but this place is worth it. Best toro-taku roll I've had in my life (kinda like negitoro but it's minced fatty tuna, shiso, and pickled radish).  Reservations required.
* **[Kaiten Sushi Numazuko](https://goo.gl/maps/yEbe54DVLvKTmVoQ8) (Shinjuku):** I have a soft spot for this no-frills conveyor belt sushi spot that I went to multiple times on my 2019 trip. It's lost a bit of its luster since then but it was still a solid lunch when I went in 2023. They have all the good stuff: seared salmon, salmon belly, aji, kinmedai, shima-aji, negitoro, toro-taku. The aburi (seared) engawa was killer. Uni and o-toro were just meh though, get your fill at Tsukiji or fancy sushi instead.

### Izakaya and Yakitori
* **[魚まみれ眞吉 渋谷店](https://goo.gl/maps/YDDPfMaJhfaXiMMQ9) (Shibuya):** solid seafood izakaya, recommended by our personal colour analyst Emi. We got the "Foreginer's Set Menu" which was actually pretty legit (i.e. it included a steamed fish head).
* **[Omoide Yokocho](https://goo.gl/maps/sHnZa7jTd8nUNiG46) (Shinjuku):** Dive-y alleyway full of yakitori (grilled skewers) spots. Most places only have seats for 10-ish. Cool vibes, though lots of smoke, and good for some late night grilled meat (chicken skin!) and beer. Fairly tourist-y nowadays and can get packed.
* **[新宿のけむり 焼鳥 居酒屋](https://goo.gl/maps/emrmxczxLYKY2k518) (Shinjuku):** More of a full sit-down restaurant than the 12-seaters in Omoide Yokocho. Order by iPad, but still with all the classsics like negima, tsukune, skin, gizzard, heart, etc. at a good price. More local too.

### Meat
* **[Katsukura](https://goo.gl/maps/H6XFSbLndJfwCDYF7) (Shinjuku):** Pork tonkatsu restaurant with high quality meat, located on the 14th floor of the Takashimaya mall. Reservation likely not needed, but it can get busy.
* **[Gyukatsu Motomura](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Gyukatsu+Motomura/@35.6876308,139.6918227,15z/data=!3m1!4b1?entry=ttu) (chain):** Beef tonkatsu restaurant where you sear off the slices of your cutlet on your own personal hot stone grill. We went to the [Shinjuku Minamiguchi location](https://goo.gl/maps/J1MuZAU2LioESVGL9) which was great, but many other locations across Tokyo are well rated too. Can be like a 1h wait so I'd recommend going before they open or at an off-hour like 3 PM.
* **[Nabezo](https://goo.gl/maps/4BqEe5TdE3PtXvfL7) (Shinjuku):** Shabu shabu (JP hot pot) restaurant with high quality meat. Reservation recommended.
* **[KINTAN](https://goo.gl/maps/shosnJwt6cfGwptY6) (Harajuku):** Yakiniku (JP BBQ) restaurant with some high quality beef. Reservations available though maybe not needed.

### Other
* **Dashi Chazuke (Shinjuku):** Not sure if it still exists... Tiny ochazuke place (tea + dashi over rice) inside Shinjuku Station; good for a light breakfast. Order via vending machine (cash).
* **[Seirinkan](https://goo.gl/maps/hYDm7CCaLozAFsXi8) (Nakameguro):** I didn't get to go here, but apparently they make _incredible_ Napoli pizza.

There are also a lot of TikToks/Insta Reels with good-looking food recs if you search for Tokyo. 

## Coffee/Kissaten
From a friend’s recommendation I discovered the _Kissaten_ scene in Tokyo, and a large chunk of my 2019 trip was sitting down at various coffeeshops with a good book. 

_Kissaten_ are Japanese-style tearooms/coffee shops. Most are based on, and some are actually from!, the Showa Era in Japan (1926-1989), with their signature wood counters where they serve you pour-over coffee in a china teacup.

Cafés, in descending order of how much I liked them:

* **[Chatei Hatou](https://peoplemakeplaces.com/place/chatei-hatou/) (Shibuya):** Beautiful and classy kissaten. The GOAT, maybe. Their aged coffee is a must-try.
* **[Tajimaya Coffee](https://tajimaya-coffeeten.com/) (Shinjuku):** Another great kissaten. Would recommend the Choco-Nut Toast set (comes with coffee). Can get packed on weekends, and is a smoking establishment. Cash only.
* **[Cafe de l’ambre](https://tokyocoffee.org/2016/05/29/cafe-de-lambre/) (Ginza):** Get their specialty: the Blanc & Noir. They chill their coffee by putting it in a cocktail mixer and spinning it on a giant slab of ice!
* **[Onibus Coffee](https://onibuscoffee.com/en/pages/copy-of-onibus-coffee-nakameguro) (Nakameguro):** Cute storefront with an upstairs with treehouse vibes
* **[Double Tall Coffee](https://doubletall.com/cafe/shinjukugyoen/) (Shinjuku):** Coffee stand with 4 bar seats indoors + some outdoor seating. Cute decor, and a tasty banana caramel latte.
* **[Coffee Fragile](https://tabelog.com/tokyo/A1304/A130401/13165114/) (Shinjuku):** 1-man operation serving quality pour-over in a dark room lined with wood shelves of old American records. Would recommend the chocolate cake set.
* **[Starbucks Reserve Roastery](https://www.starbucksreserve.com/en-us/locations/tokyo) (Nakameguro):** One of the many around the world, to ensure that Starbucks will survive in case of an apocalyptic event. Beautiful location with 3 floors and a terrace. There _will be_ a wait at peak times and on weekends–I tried stopping by on my 2023 trip and the wait was 75-90 mins 😲 so we walked over to the Tsutaya Books instead

## Personal Colour Analysis
Would recommend!

A brief intro: someone somewhere created this systematic way of identifying what your "personal colours" are, essentially what colours to wear to make your features sparkle, that has blown up over the past couple years. (Or at least that's when I started seeing TikToks of English-speakers flying to Korea for this service.)

I'm probably butchering the details, but at a high level: there are 4 "seasons" of colours (groupings, generally either yellow undertones or blue undertones) with 4 subcategories within each season, for 1 of 16 different combinations you could fall under. Different colours add yellow to your face (which may be good or bad), or add blue to your face (which may be good or bad), and can do everything from wash out your skin tone, to make you look tired and highlight your eyebags, to make your eyes light up. Your personal colour analyst will lay colour swatches on your chest and compare between different ones to find your palette. I, for one, was clearly a Vivid Winter.

There are lots of salons in Tokyo offering this service at a reasonable price, with additional services for women like Facial Structure Analysis and Make-up Suggestions. For options and booking:

* **[Beauty Style Salon](https://beautystyle.co.jp/) ([Shimomeguro](https://goo.gl/maps/JU5dojY2DxrNSLqr6))** is where I did mine
    * 1h combined session for back-to-back analyses for me and my friend cost ¥19,800 total ~= ~$75 USD per person
    * To book, [email the salon](https://beautystyle.co.jp/contact/) in English for availability, and ask for Emi, she's great!
    * I was able to book just a couple weeks in advance
* **[TATSUMI](https://bestcolors4you.com/englishmenu/) (Shinjuku 1 Chome)** is another popular salon that offers service in English, that I found from a random reddit comment
    * 1.5h personal colour analysis costs ¥16,000 ~= $110 USD
    * [The full service](https://bestcolors4you.com/menuforwomen/) 3h session including a colour diagnosis, face+skeletal diagnosis, and makeup tips costs ¥30,000 ~= $210 USD
    * Note: this salon appears to be [booked out months in advance](https://bestcolors4you.com/%e3%81%94%e4%ba%88%e7%b4%84%e5%8f%af%e8%83%bd%e6%97%a5/), so book early!
* To find other options, I'd recommend googling "パーソナルカラー診断 東京" (= "personal colour analysis tokyo"), contacting them (ideally in English + some Google-Translated-Japanese), and asking if they offer service in English. This is how I found my place actually!

## Shopping
I did A LOT of shopping this time around, split between luxury thrift stores, Japanese modern brands, and dinnerware.

Part of this was a superb (for me but not for my wallet) [Airbnb Experience](https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/679792) we booked with local fashion industry expert Keisuke-san, who took us on a shopping trip through Omotesando and Ura-hara. Not only did he show us the low-key high quality brands, but he also took into account our preferences and helped us with styling tips, sizing, and translating with shopkeepers. Would recommend!

Here are some of my favourite brands/stores we went to, with Keisuke-san and also on our own:

* [Kindal](https://www.kind.co.jp/) (luxury thrift store chain with locations all around Tokyo and Osaka, we went to like 5 of these lol)
* [UNITED ARROWS](https://store.united-arrows.co.jp/) (Harajuku and Roppongi Hills locations)
* [BEAMS](https://www.beams.co.jp/) (Shinjuku) and BEAMS Plus (Harajuku)
* [FreshService](https://freshservice.jp/)
* [MINEDENIM](https://minedenim.co.jp/)
* [GLAD HAND & Co.](https://shop.glad-hand.com/)
* [glamb](https://www.glamb-lodge.com/)
* [sacai](https://www.sacai.jp/en-pt/)
* [White Mountaineering](https://whitemountaineering.com/)
* [Yohji Yamamoto](https://www.yohjiyamamoto.co.jp/en/)
* [Stone Island](https://www.stoneisland.com/us) (not a JP brand, but was sold a lot in stores in Tokyo and I like their stuff)

_Some bonus reflections:_

There's so much shopping that can be done in Tokyo, that it can be overwhelming. Thankfully my travel buddy had some shops and brands already in mind that he wanted to check out. This was a first for me, really spending large amounts of time and money finding clothes that both fit well and look fly, and it was a lot of fun! It helped having my energy directed at the limited set of brands my friend was into, and separately it helped that there's just something about the fit of the clothes from Asian brands on me that's \*chef's kiss\*. Feels good to have a sorta new, overhauled wardrobe that I can rock.

P.S. I'd love to hear any other Tokyo or Japan recommendations you have! I'm hoping to go again, and I’m always interested in trying new/cool things.
