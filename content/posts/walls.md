I've started to notice a recurring set of Walls I keep running into in life, a bit like level caps on a video game character, though not exactly. In a sense they are self-sustaining, in that they are sustainted by me (or part of some past version of me that I hold onto that was adaptive but has now become maladaptive).

I run into these Walls, recognize them, greet them and say "Hello again. I see you but I can never seem to get past you." Some days I'm able to chisel away at a Wall a tiny bit before backing off, other days I think _yeah nope not today_ and back off all the same.

Not to say that I think these Walls are permanent. In fact, I'm confident that one day I'll have chipped away enough at these Walls that they crumble, and I'll spend some time clearing out the chunks of rubble before safely stepping on through to the other side. In the meantime, progress is slow. (Because if it was easy, then it wouldn't be a Wall with a captial w.)

As a bit of an experiment, I'm going to try to maintain a list here. I'll add items as I encounter them.

### The List

* <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/sabbatical-notes/5/">**Self-worth gap**</a>
<small>
    * Wanting to **always be productive**, always be doing better
    * Wanting to **Get Good** via deliberate practice (full post to come, in the meantime here's a <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/billyisyoung/status/1834924289885098266">preview</a>)

</small>

* **Shame** and **judgment**
<small>
    * Being afraid to be my full self, or to be perceived
    * Being criticized by others and myself
    * The feeling of a pit in my stomach
    * Related: an **automatic self-doubt response**, e.g. I want to ask a stranger to help take a photo of me but then I hesitate, pull back, and think; and then the opportunity is gone[^2]

</small> <!-- for formatting reasons i have to add the blank lines like this otherwise the last bullet remains big... -->

* _**Dukkha**_[^1]
<small>
    * Fear that "this is it" -- that I'll have to live with this feeling of disharmony, dissatisfaction, dukkha for the rest of my days

</small>

* **Fit-It reflex**
<small>
    * Trying to immediately jump to problem-solving away any negative feelings
    * How do you stop chasing, and be present? How do you learn to sit still, and not feel like you're wasting time?

</small>

[^2]: I've been <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/billyisyoung/status/1832471084651761968">thinking a lot</a> recently about this piece of advice that goes like, "Think about where you want to be in 2 years, and start acting like that person today." I think it applies here -- these Walls are kind of like manifestations of Old Patterns. You don't ask strangers to help take your photo, because... why? Because you're not that kind of person? But if you do want to become that type of person, in a sense you have to become someone new (some like to say _killing_ the person you are now), because the person you are now ISN'T flagging down the stranger.

[^1]: _Dukkha_ - Sanskrit: दुःख; "bad space" is a translation I'm fond of; also "unease", "unsatisfactory", "suffering"
