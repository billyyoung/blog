Hello! Welcome to my fledgling corner of the internet.

This is a place for me to write and focus on what I want to see more of. A big one for me is: **I want to see more people doing the things they love**. And that starts with myself.

Some of my values include: **Beauty**, **Industry** ("to work hard and well at my life tasks"), **Passion**, **Intimacy**, and **Self-Knowledge**.

My interests tend to cluster around two topics: Personal Development and Doing Things.

I like <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/letter-29/">introspection</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/comparisons/">figuring myself out</a>. I like <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/5-25/">improving</a>. I like chatting about psychology, <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/brain-and-ego/">neuroscience</a> and philosophy of mind, and personality stuff (Enneagram: 4w5; INTJ; cusp-y ♍️☼♐☾♋↑).

I like playing music (drums, singing, piano), cooking, drawing, volleyball, coding, and making the occasional <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/taxes/">spreadsheet</a>.

In June 2023 <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/new-game-plus/">I left my job</a> of 7 years in software engineering, and I'm currently on a sabbatical!

### Living in SF
I moved to San Francisco after graduating college in 2016, and I've been living here since (8 years now!). But I think from 2020 onward is when I really started to enjoy living here. Most Sunday mornings you can find me playing <a target="_blank" href="https://heylo.group/sfbv">volleyball</a> at Ocean Beach.

If you're ever in town, I'd <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/billyisyoung/status/1745704925831831706">love</a> to hear your story. <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/billyisyoung">DM me</a> and let's grab coffee!

### On sabbatical
In June 2023 I left my job of 7 years in software engineering, and went on a sabbatical.

After 6 months, I realized that the main thing I want to focus on is: rewiring myself away from grasping for external validation of my work as a necessary component of my worth, and cultivating an internal wellspring of self-worth and self-love.

I recognize now that more achievements and other external things won't truly satisfy me, and that satisfaction must come from within. So I'm <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/sabbatical-notes/5/">working on that</a>.

In the meantime, I'm doing creative work that I love.

### Sabbatical projects
Right now I'm spending my time:

- Doing (free) <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7110433966653935616/">career consults</a>, answering people's questions about career and career transitions
- Writing blog posts here
- Playing the drums, learning new songs, and making the occasional <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7jtI4stySI">cover video</a>
- <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/billyy_art/">Drawing</a>

**Projects I've completed since June 2023**
