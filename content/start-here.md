Hello! Welcome to my fledgling corner of the internet.

This is a place for me to write, and focus on what I want to see more of. For one, **I want to see more people doing the things they love**, and that starts with myself, so here we are.

Some of my values include: **Beauty**, **Industry** ("to work hard and well at my life tasks"), **Intimacy**, and **Self-Knowledge**.

I'm a bit of an **indoor cat**. I'm introspective, and I like psychology, philosophy of mind, and personality stuff (Enneagram: 4w5; INTJ; cusp-y Virgo/Libra).

I like playing music (drums, singing, piano), cooking, drawing, beach volleyball, coding, and trading stocks.

In June 2023 <a target="_blank" href="https://billy.dev/posts/new-game-plus/">I left my job of 7 years</a> in software engineering, took a 2-year <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:1313/posts/sabbatical-notes/">sabbatical</a>, and now I'm in grad school to get a PsyD.

## What I'm doing now
<small>_Inspired by Derek Sivers' <a target="_blank" href="https://nownownow.com/about">now page</a> movement_</small>

I started grad school in Aug 2025, and that's taking up most of my time and energy. I have practicum three days a week, and classes two days a week.

But there's no place I'd rather be right now :)


## All of my various things
I like to do all sorts of things! Here's where you can find me:

- I **write** here
- I **draw** and post my latest works at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/billyy_art/">@billyy_art</a>; or see where I started from <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/billyisyoung/status/1328059097783160838">in 2020</a>
