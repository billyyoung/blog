Hello! Welcome to my fledgling corner of the internet.

This is a place for me to write and focus on what I want to see more of. A big one for me is: **I want to see more people doing the things they love**. And that starts with myself.

Some of my values include: **Beauty**, **Industry** ("to work hard and well at my life tasks"), **Passion**, **Intimacy**, and **Self-Knowledge**.

My interests tend to cluster around two topics: Personal Development and Doing The Thing.

I like [introspection](https://billy.dev/posts/letter-29/) and [figuring myself out](https://billy.dev/posts/comparisons/). I like [improving](https://billy.dev/posts/5-25/). I like chatting about psychology, [neuroscience](https://billy.dev/posts/brain-and-ego/) and philosophy of mind, and personality stuff (Enneagram: 4w5; INTJ; cusp-y ♍️☼♐☾♋↑).

I like playing music (drums, singing, piano), cooking, drawing, volleyball, coding, and making the occasional [spreadsheet](https://billy.dev/posts/taxes/).

In June 2023 [I left my job](https://billy.dev/posts/new-game-plus/) of 7 years in software engineering, and I'm currently on a sabbatical!

### Living in SF
I moved to San Francisco after graduating college in 2016, and I've been living here since (7 years now!). But I think from 2020 onward is when I really started to enjoy living here. Most Sunday mornings you can find me playing [volleyball](https://heylo.group/sfbv) at Ocean Beach.

If you're ever in town, [DM me](https://twitter.com/billyisyoung) and let's grab coffee!

### On sabbatical
In June 2023 I left my job of 7 years in software engineering, and went on a sabbatical.

I’d love to eventually carve out a way of living and working that’s more satisfying for me than my prior experience with the typical corporate path. But really, I have no idea what that entails or where this is headed; I'm making plans up as I go.

Week to week, it's been a lot of internal work: reassessing what I want vs what I think I want, reconnecting with what I find [Fun](https://billy.dev/posts/sabbatical-notes/2-fun/), and Doing Things.

### Sabbatical projects
Right now I'm spending my time:

- [Chatting with people](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7110433966653935616/) and answering their questions about career and career transitions
- Writing blog posts here
- Playing the drums, learning new songs, and making the occasional [cover video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7jtI4stySI)
- [Drawing](https://www.instagram.com/billyy_art/)
