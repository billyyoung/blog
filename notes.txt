_index.md in /posts/ subfolders apply the front matter to all posts in the folder
but i'm currently hacking it a bit to use it as a template for the list.html page for the subfolder, e.g. /posts/sabbatical-notes/

If I ever want to convert my posts to /yyyy/mm/dd/name format:
- setup permalinks in config - https://gohugo.io/content-management/urls/#permalinks-configuration-example
- back-compat for existing posts - https://gohugo.io/content-management/urls/#yaml-front-matter

updated the config on my submodules (.gitmodules) to no longer use the billyyoung.github.com domain and just use github.com. This is because I no longer have the conflicting SSH keys problem and am using the default SSH key setup, so I don't have special SSH behaviour for billyyoung.github.com
